\section{Mairi's Corrections}

\subsection{Point 2: Drawbacks of Inflation}
\textbf{Added to discussion on Pg 36:}

In this thesis inflation is taken to be the mechanism by which inhomogeneities in matter are seeded
and the horizon and flatness problems of the Big Bang are solved. However, the inflationary
paradigm is not without its own challenges.

Chief amongst these is the lack of a unique underlying theory. Many high energy theories have been
shown to produce an inflationary phase. Often, however, these require a great deal of fine-tuning
in order to produce a sufficient number of e-foldings of inflation. Lack of knowledge about the
governing physics at high energy scales hampers our understanding of the cause of inflation and
undermines any analysis of the generic nature of the initial conditions required.

The overall duration of inflation is also unknown. Observations only require that currently
observable scales were previously inside the horizon. Thus the onset of inflation is not
constrained and could occur far in the past. However, allowing such a long inflationary period
typically increases the fine-tuning necessary and can lead to other issues. 

There are further problems with the inflationary paradigm, including the lack of an explanation for
how energy in the inflaton field is transferred to the other constituent parts of the universe, and
indeed the fact that no scalar field has yet been directly observed.

We will continue to employ the inflationary paradigm in this thesis but it is important to
acknowledge that some challenges remain to be overcome.

\subsection{Point 3: T-duality discussion}
\textbf{Inserted on Pg 40 just below Section 3.2.2 header:}

In string theory an extra space time symmetry is present which relates physical properties in
theories with large compactification radius with those in theories with small radius. 
Suppose we have a string theory compactified on a circle of radius $L$. The ``T-duality''
transformation which relates two physical theories with this one compactified dimension is
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tdualtransform-dbiintro}
 L \rightarrow \wt{L} = \frac{\alpha'}{L}\,.
\end{equation}
% 
Now consider what effect this transformation will have on the momentum of a closed string. Instead
of being a continuum, the momentum takes discrete values \ldots
\\

\textbf{Rephrased end of Section 3.2.2 on Pg 41 as follows:}

The formula for the mass spectrum, \eq{eq:closedmass-dbiintro}, is invariant
when $j$ and $w$ are exchanged given the transformation in \eq{eq:tdualtransform-dbiintro}.
Writing the equations of motion in terms of $\wt{L}$, having interchanged $j$ and
$w$, gives a new theory which is compactified on a circle of radius $\wt{L}$. This is known as the
T-dual theory \cite{Sakai1986,Kikkawa1984b}. The two
theories are physically identical since T-duality is an exact symmetry
of string theory for closed strings. The T-duality applies to all physics in the theory and in
particular also affects open string modes. These behave in a different way under T-duality to closed
strings as will be described below.
\\

\textbf{Rephrased part of Section 3.2.3 on Pg 41 as follows:}

We introduced T-duality by explaining
its effects on closed strings. But what happens to the open strings in a T-dualised theory? Open
strings, as their name suggests, have two open ends and
consequently cannot have a conserved winding number such as $w$. Suppose once more
that one
of the $D$ dimensions is compactified. As $L\rightarrow0$, the non-zero momentum
states become infinitely massive, but in contrast to the closed case there is now
no continuum of winding states. Thus, the open string now lives in $D-1$ dimensions
similar to the result of standard KK compactification \cite{Johnson2000}.
The endpoints of the open strings 
then observe Dirichlet boundary conditions, taking fixed values in the compactified
direction.
There are still closed strings in this theory, however, and these continue to
move in the full $D$ dimensions after being T-dualised.  

The result is similar if more than
one coordinate is made periodic.
If $D-p-1$ spatial dimensions are compactified, for some $p$, then the ends of
the open
strings can still move freely in the other $p$ spatial dimensions on a $p+1$
dimensional hypersurface. This hypersurface is called a Dirichlet brane or
D$p$-brane. The closed string modes move in the full $D$ dimensions.



\subsection{Point 4: Validity of Eq 3.28}
\textbf{Added to end of Pg 48:}

In deriving \eq{eq:approxlyth-dbiintro} we have assumed that $r/\cs \PX$ varies slowly during
observable inflation. For the DBI case, $\cs \PX = 1$ and the change in $r$ can be related to the
change in $\epsilon_H$ and $\cs$ through \eq{eq:rdefn-dbiintro}. As we have taken $\epsilon_H,
|\eta_H|,|s|\ll 1$ the tensor-scalar ratio will indeed vary slowly over the observable epoch.
% 
For more general models where $\cs \PX \ne 1$ we have that
% 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\d }{\d \N}\left[ \frac{r}{\cs \PX}\right] = 16\frac{\epsilon_H}{\PX}\left( 2\epsilon_H
-2\eta_H\right)\,.
\end{equation}
% 
Therefore $r/\cs\PX$ varies slowly as long as $\PX$ is not too small, \iec close to
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_H^2)$. This will not be the case in the models studied in Chapters
\ref{ch:dbi} and \ref{ch:multibrane}.

\subsection{Point 5: No isocurvature mode considered}
\textbf{Added to Perturbation section on Pg 24:}

For single field models no mixing
of adiabatic and non-adiabatic modes occurs \cite{Weinberg200804}. Therefore, throughout this
thesis we will only consider adiabatic perturbations and ignore any isocurvature mode present.
