In the past cosmology was a speculative science. The scarcity of observational
data meant that many conflicting theories of the evolution of the universe were
entertained with nothing but personal opinion to differentiate between them.
The explosion in the quantity and quality of observational data in recent years
has led to a much more competitive market place for ideas about the physical
beginning of everything.

The Big Bang scenario has emerged as a cohesive framework for the evolution of
the universe from very early times. The observation of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) provided much supporting evidence for this scenario
\cite{book:kolbturner}. This
relic radiation emitted 300,000 years after the Big Bang continues to
be our primary source of information about the early universe.

The inflationary scenario is an attempt to solve problems with the standard Big
Bang picture and provide an origin for the fluctuations in energy that seeded
the growth of structure in the universe
\cite{Starobinsky:1980te,Guth:1980zm,Albrecht:1982wi,Linde:1981mu,
Starobinsky:1982ee}. These fluctuations link the classical scales of
relativistic gravity with the quantum scales of Planck level physics. There are
many possible realisations of inflation and there has been an explosion in the
number of theoretical models which agree with current observational limits
(for reviews see for example \cite{book:liddle, Alabidi:2008ej, Baumann2009}).

Ground and spaced based observations have significantly challenged theoretical
cosmological models with a wealth of new data. The Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe mission (WMAP) \cite{Komatsu:2008hk} in conjunction with supernova
surveys and other evidence have shown that the fluctuations in
temperature of the CMB are $10^{-5}$ times smaller than the background value
and that the magnitudes of the fluctuations are roughly independent of the
angular scales at which they are measured. This is in agreement with the
predictions of inflationary models and has led to other scenarios being ruled
out. An upper bound has also been placed
on the amplitude of gravitational wave perturbations and bounds have been
placed on the deviation of the fluctuations from a purely random Gaussian
distribution.

Constraining the parameter space of inflationary models is an important step
towards limiting the number of observationally viable models, and ultimately
singling out one of these as the description of the physics of the early
universe. 
% In this work theoretical and numerical methods are used to constrain
% particular classes of inflationary models.

The goal of this work is to constrain inflationary models in two very different
ways: by deriving theoretical limits on their parameter space and demonstrating
a numerical calculation which will allow the investigation of higher order
perturbations. Both these methods have the potential to seriously limit the
models investigated and possibly rule these scenarios out.


In Chapter~\ref{ch:introduction} the foundations are laid for these investigations.
The geometry and physics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe are presented and
inflationary cosmology is introduced to alleviate problems with the standard Big
Bang scenario. Slow roll conditions are then defined to ensure an adequate duration
of inflation occurs. Despite its elegance, this homogeneous universe is, however,
exceedingly dull. To understand the inhomogeneities present in reality, first order
cosmological perturbation theory is employed. Models with non-canonical
actions can also be considered. The relationships between observable quantities and
the model parameters are altered in this case meaning these models could be
distinguished from those with canonical actions. The departure of primordial
perturbations from a Gaussian random distribution could also reveal significant
information about the underlying physics at work.


In Part~\ref{part:dbi} of this work theoretical bounds are placed on a class of
non-canonical inflationary models. These models illustrate the dynamics of
extended objects called branes in superstring theory and are considered some of
the most promising candidates for achieving inflation using string theory.

Chapter~\ref{ch:dbi-intro} outlines the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scenario in
terms of the string theoretic background and how it applies in four-dimensions
as a realisation of inflation. The six extra dimensions required by string theory
play an integral role in this scenario. These are compactified into a complex
manifold whose geometry allows extended regions called throats to exist. DBI
inflation consists of a brane moving in one of the throats. The inflaton field is
the radial distance of the brane from the tip of the throat. Translating the
higher-dimensional motion into four dimensions introduces a square-root into the
effective action. The real nature of the action then enforces an upper bound on the
kinetic energy of the inflaton allowing a sufficiently long period of inflation. The
inflaton field variation during its movement in the throat is directly linked to the
amplitude of tensor modes which can be produced by a result due to Lyth
\cite{lyth}.


In Chapter~\ref{ch:dbi} the repercussions of this relationship between the change in
the field and the tensor mode amplitude is explored further. In the DBI scenario,
Baumann \& McAllister \cite{bmpaper} used the Lyth bound to place a conservative
upper bound on the total production of tensor modes during inflation by assuming the
brane does not move further than the length of the throat. By considering only the
period of observable inflation, which takes place over a much smaller region of the
throat, this bound is considerably strengthened. In the generic case the ratio
of amplitudes of tensor and scalar perturbations must be less than $10^{-7}$. This
is below the sensitivity of even the most optimistic forecasts for future
observational experiments. 

If attention is limited to brane motion down the throat, another complementary bound
on the tensor modes can be derived which is based on the non-Gaussianity produced
by the model. The DBI scenario is inherently non-Gaussian in nature but even assuming
the largest levels allowed by observations the tensor modes are bounded to being
above $0.005$. These two theoretical bounds are clearly incompatible in the generic
case and only a very fine-tuned selection of model parameters allows the standard
DBI scenario to survive. By taking a more phenomenological approach, keeping
the square-root in the action while allowing the other parameters to vary,
conditions under which the bounds can be relaxed are found.


A class of models which evade this bound are found in
Chapter~\ref{ch:multibrane}. One particular model in this class is a
multi-coincident brane scenario with a small finite number of branes.


Part~\ref{part:numerical} applies numerical techniques to investigate the
production of second order cosmological perturbations. In
Chapter~\ref{ch:perts} the Klein-Gordon equation of the second order
scalar field perturbation is described purely in terms of the field itself.
This equation is the basis of the numerical calculation in
Chapter~\ref{ch:numericalsystem} which is tested for two standard inflationary
potentials.

Throughout this work units are chosen such that $\Mpl \equiv (8\pi G )^{-1/2}=
2.4 \times 10^{18}\, {\rm GeV}$ defines the reduced Planck mass and $c=\hbar =1$. 

An overdot ($\dot{~}$) is used for differentiation with respect to proper
time $t$ and a prime ($'$) for differentiation with respect to conformal time
$\eta$. The dagger symbol ($^\dagger$) denotes differentiation with respect to the
number of e-foldings $\N$.

A subscripted comma denotes partial differentiation by the symbol it
precedes, \eg $f_{,\varphi} = \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial \varphi}$.
