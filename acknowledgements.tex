\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank Jim Lidsey, Karim Malik and Reza Tavakol for all their help and
guidance. Thank you to the past and present members of Room 301, and all my other colleagues in
QMUL who make working there such a pleasant experience.

I am very grateful to Cathy, Sara, Susan, Lisa, Kevin, Fiona and Andrew for putting up with me over
the past few years and making the move to London so enjoyable. And thank you to all my friends for
for not letting me talk about work when around them.

I am indebted to my parents, Brian and Phil, and my brother and sister, Paul and Anne for all
their support and encouragement. 

Finally, I could not have survived the last few years and especially the last few months without 
Gr\'{a}inne beside me. Thank you for everything.
