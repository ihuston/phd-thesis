\declaration{%
I hereby certify that this thesis, which is approximately 45,000 words in length,
has been written by me, that it is the record of the work carried out by me at the
Astronomy Unit, Queen Mary, University of London, and that it has not been submitted
in any previous application for a higher degree.
\\
Chapter~\ref{ch:dbi} primarily contains work done with James E.
Lidsey and published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP)
\cite{lidseyhuston}. Section~\ref{sec:twlargen-multi} also contains work published
in \Rref{lidseyhuston}.
% 
The majority of Chapter~\ref{ch:multibrane} is based on work completed in
collaboration with James E. Lidsey, Steven Thomas and John Ward and published in JCAP
\cite{hltw}. 
% 
Chapters~\ref{ch:perts}, \ref{ch:numericalsystem} and \ref{ch:results} contain work
done with Karim Malik, and large parts of these chapters were published in JCAP
\cite{hustonmalik}.
\\
I have made a major contribution to all the original research presented in this
thesis.
