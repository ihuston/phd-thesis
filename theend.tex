As the number of cosmological models grows, the need to constrain them is also
increasing. At the same time, the quantity and quality of observational data are
advancing. There now exists the opportunity to go beyond linear statistical analyses
and confront the predictions of models with observational data from the non-linear
regime. In this thesis both analytic and numerical methods have been used to
constrain inflationary models.

The framework used was the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe, which was reviewed
in Chapter~\ref{ch:introduction}. During the accelerated expansion of the
inflationary period, quantum fluctuations seeded energy density variations which
gave rise to the diverse structure in the universe. First order perturbation theory
was introduced to describe these fluctuations. Using the Bunch-Davies vacuum initial
conditions, observational predictions for the inflationary scenario were made.

The main observable quantities are the power spectrum of scalar perturbations, its
spectral index, and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations. In addition to
these the degree of departure of the perturbations from purely Gaussian statistics
was considered in the local and equilateral cases.

In Part~\ref{part:dbi} of this thesis, analytic methods were used to constrain
string theory inspired inflationary models. The Dirac-Born-Infeld scenario was
outlined in Chapter~\ref{ch:dbi-intro}. In this model, a D3-brane propagates in a
six-dimensional warped throat. The radial position of the brane from the tip of the
throat assumes the role of the inflaton field. The non-canonical nature of the DBI
action restricts the kinetic energy of this field no matter how steep the potential
which enables an inflationary period of sufficient duration to occur.
This model was widely regarded as a very promising implementation of an inflationary
model in a string-theory context.

In \Rref{bmpaper}, Baumann and McAllister used the Lyth bound \cite{lyth} to limit
the tensor-scalar ratio based on the conservative assumption that the brane could
not propogate further than the full length of the throat. In Chapter~\ref{ch:dbi},
we showed that this bound can be tightened by applying it over the
portion of the throat which the brane passes through during the directly observable
e-foldings of inflation. Restricting the field variation to be over these,
approximately, four e-foldings constrains $r$ to be less than $10^{-7}$ for standard
parameter values.

The most optimistic estimates of advances in experimental techniques and data
analysis, including foreground reduction, indicate that observations of $r>10^{-4}$
might be achievable \cite{Baumann:2008aq,vpj}. Therefore, the new bound in
\eq{eq:upperbound} immediately rules out the observation of a tensor mode signal
from this model in the foreseeable future.

In addition to this, we also derived a lower bound on $r$ in \eq{eq:lowerbound}.
This depends on observable quantities, namely the scalar spectral index and the
equilateral non-gaussianity. Saturating the WMAP5 observational limit on $\fnleq$
and taking the best fit value for $n_s$, we found that the most conservative lower
limit is $r>0.005$. This is clearly incompatible with the previously derived upper
bound. Therefore, for standard parameter values, the D3-brane DBI scenario is not
viable. Numerical simulations by Peiris \etal in \Rref{Peiris:2007gz} have
demonstrated the lower bound using the
Hamiltonian flow approach and the relativistic limit.

The discovery of the inconsistent bounds for DBI inflation has had a noticeable
impact on the research community, spurring interest in finding models which evade
these bounds. Many such models have been proposed with varying degrees of success. In
Section~\ref{sec:others-dbi} these were categorised according to whether they
featured single or multiple fields and single or multiple branes. 

In Section~\ref{sec:relaxing-dbi}, a phenomenological approach was taken to easing
the upper bound. By considering a DBI action with unspecified field functions,
$f_i$, we showed that the generalised lower and upper bounds can be consistent
if the product of $f_1$ and $f_2$ is large on observable scales.


% Multi
More general actions which relax the bounds were derived in
Chapter~\ref{ch:multibrane}. By retaining the proportionality of $\Lambda$ and
$c_s^{-2}$, which is present in the DBI model, and requiring that $\fnleq$ is large,
we found a class of actions similar in form to DBI. 
Instead of a square-root in the kinetic term, the index of the central term of these
actions depends on the constant of proportionality between $\Lambda$ and the sound
speed.
The upper bound on $r$ can be derived for these general actions and when the index
is below the critical value of $1/2$ of the standard DBI scenario, this bound is
significantly relaxed. When new models are proposed the
phenomenological description of this family of actions allows easy identification of
those models for which the bound on $r$ is less stringent. 

One proposed, multi brane, single field model is the coincident brane scenario of
Thomas \& Ward \cite{thomasward}. When $n$ D3-branes propogate in a throat, the
non-Abelian interactions between the branes result in major departures from the
single brane case. This is in contrast to the non-interacting branes model in which
the total action is simply the sum of copies of the single brane action.

In the limit of a large number of branes being coincident, the effective action is
similar to $n$ times the single brane one with the addition of a fuzzy potential
term. The bounds on $r$ can be somewhat relaxed when this potential term is large
but this model is still strongly constrained by current observations. For an $AdS_5$
throat, standard parameter choices limit the number of branes in this case to being
less than 150, at which point the assumption of arbitrarily large $n$ is
questionable.

More promising is the finite $n$ limit of the coincident brane model. The
non-Abelian nature of the interactions leads in this case to a recursive definition
of the $n$-brane action in terms of the $n=2$ one. In
Section~\ref{sec:finiten-multi} we showed that the action for finite $n$ is one of
the class of bound-evading actions described above. This identification is possible
because the last term of the recursive sum dominates in the relativistic limit. This
approximation is valid at least when $n<10$. The backreaction of the multiple
branes is kept well under control for this range of $n$.

Although the bounds on $r$ are eased
for this model, we showed that observations strongly constrain the possibility of
production of an observable tensor signal. If an observable tensor-scalar ratio is
considered to be $r>10{-4}$ then only the two or three brane cases are capable of
producing such a signal. This bound on $n$ depends on the WMAP5 limit on $\fnleq$.
If, as expected, the observational limits on $\fnleq$ tighten considerably in the
future, the possibility of an observable tensor signal from the multi coincident
brane model could be ruled out.
