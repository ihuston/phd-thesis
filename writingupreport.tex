\title{Application to transfer to writing up status}
\author{Ian Huston}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

This document outlines my plan to complete my thesis by 1st November 2009. I am requesting a
transfer to writing-up status beginning on the 20th September 2009. I have already begun the
process of writing-up and believe that I can complete my work in the timetable provided below.
