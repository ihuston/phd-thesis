Inflationary cosmology is the leading explanation of the very early universe. 
Many specific models have been derived which agree with current observations.
The non-gaussianity of the universe shortly after the Big Bang has emerged as
an important tool to differentiate between these models. In this work
two aspects of the search for non-gaussianity are described.

First, string-inspired models with large non-gaussianity are investigated.
% First paper
An upper bound on the primordial gravitational wave spectrum
generated during ultra-violet Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation is derived. 

% The bound is insensitive
% to the form of the inflaton potential and the warp factor of the compactified
% dimensions and can be expressed entirely in terms of observational parameters
% once the volume of the five-dimensional sub-manifold of the throat has been
% specified. 
The bound predicts
undetectably small tensor perturbations with a tensor-scalar ratio $r <
10^{-7}$. 
This is incompatible with a corresponding lower limit of $r > 0.1
(1-n_s)$, which applies to any model that generates a red spectral index $n_s
<1$ and a potentially detectable non-gaussianity.
% Possible ways of evading these bounds in more general DBI-type scenarios are
% discussed and a multiple-brane model is investigated as a specific example. 

% Second Paper
Extending this analysis, a class of non-canonical inflationary models is
identified where the leading-order contribution to the non-gaussianity is
determined by the sound speed of the fluctuations in
the inflaton field. 
This class of models includes the effective action for
multiple coincident branes in the finite $n$ limit. 
% The action for this
% configuration is determined using an iterative technique, based upon the
% fundamental representation of SU(2). 
The upper bounds on $r$ in the single-brane
DBI scenario can be relaxed in multi-brane configurations if a large and
detectable non-gaussianity is generated. 
% Moreover models with a small number of
% coincident branes could generate a gravitational wave background that will be
% observable to future experiments. 

% Third paper
The second aspect method of constraining inflationary models is the numerical calculation
of second order perturbations for a general class of single field models.
The Klein-Gordon equation at second
order is numerically solved in closed form. 
The slow-roll
version of the second order source term is used and the method is
shown to be extendable to the full equation.
% We consider two standard single field models and find that
% the results agree with previous calculations using analytic methods, where
% comparison is possible. 
The procedure allows the evolution of second order
perturbations in general and the calculation of the non-gaussianity parameter in cases
where there is no analytical solution available.
