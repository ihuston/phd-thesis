The inflationary scenario provides the 
theoretical framework for the early history 
of the universe. It has now been successfully tested by observations, 
including the five year data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy 
Probe (WMAP5) \cite{Komatsu:2008hk}. Despite this success, however, the high energy 
physics that resulted in a phase of accelerated expansion is still 
not well understood. String/M-theory attempts to unify the fundamental interactions 
including gravity and it is natural and important to 
develop inflationary models within string theory and to confront them with 
cosmological observations. 
 

One class of string-theoretic models that has received 
considerable attention is D-brane inflation
\cite{brane1,brane2,brane3,brane4,brane5,
brane6,brane7,brane8,brane9,brane10,brane11,brane12,brane13,

Mukhanov:2005bu,Kallosh:2007wm,brane18,
brane19,brane20,brane21}. 
(For recent reviews, see, e.g., \cite{tyereview,cline,McAllister:2007bg,Lorenz:2007ze,
Bean:2007eh,bean}). 
% Of particular interest 
% is the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflationary scenario \cite{brane6,brane11}.
The Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scenario 
of the compactified type IIB theory is a well-motivated model \cite{brane6,brane11}, 
in which inflation is driven by one or more ${\rm D}$-branes 
propagating in a warped `throat' background. 
% 
In the simplest version of the scenario, 
the inflaton parametrizes the radial 
position in the throat of a single ${\rm D3}$-brane. 
The brane dynamics are determined by the DBI action in such a 
way that the inflaton's kinetic energy is bounded from above by the warped 
brane tension. The regime where this bound is nearly saturated is 
known as the `relativistic' limit.

In Chapters \ref{ch:dbi-intro}, \ref{ch:dbi} and \ref{ch:multibrane} we will 
explore the observational consequences of DBI inflation. 
In general, primordial gravitational wave fluctuations
and non-Gaussian statistics in the curvature perturbation provide 
two powerful discriminants of inflationary scenarios. 
The nature of the DBI action is such that the sound 
speed of fluctuations in the inflaton can be much less than the speed of 
light. This induces a large and potentially detectable non-Gaussian 
signal in the density perturbations \cite{brane6,brane11,lidser3,chenetal}. 


In this chapter we introduce non-canonical inflation and DBI inflation.
In Chapter \ref{ch:dbi} we will derive upper and lower 
limits on the amplitude of the tensor perturbations in Sections \ref{sec:upper-dbi} and  
\ref{sec:lower-dbi} respectively.  
We will explore how these bounds may be relaxed in Chapter \ref{ch:multibrane} and discuss multi-brane 
scenarios which permit observational tensor signals.

Unification of seemingly disparate theories has been a driving force in
theoretical physics for more than 100 years. This effort culminated in the
Standard Model (SM) of particle physics which unifies three of the four
fundamental forces in a robust theoretical framework. Since the realization of
the SM a clear goal of theoretical physics has been the unification of the
final force, gravity, into this framework. In this section we will introduce
some of the concepts that will be required later to understand DBI inflation.
\addtodo{Include more citations}
Many review articles and text books have been about string theory and its
application to cosmology, a short list of recent works includes
\cite{Polchinski1996,cline,Johnson2000}.


String theory is one of the most successful current attempts to achieve the
unification of physics. According to this theory, the fundamental
building blocks of the
universe are vibrating bundles of energy. These ``strings'', and their analogues
in other dimensions, constitute all matter and force particles in existence.
There are two main
types of strings, closed and open, distinguished by the fact that closed
strings form a continuous loop while open strings have two unconnected ends. 
% The physics of their interactions dictates the physics of the SM which has
% been
% so successfully tested.
% 
% This at least is the goal of the string theory project but the complex nature
% of the mathematical and physical structures involved means that no single
% well-defined theory can claim to have achieved this goal. Indeed many
% different
% string theories have been discovered. This might appear to be a significant
% set-back in the attempt to find a single unifying theory. 


There are several different string theories linked in pairs by a process
called
duality. Physical descriptions in one theory can be translated into a
dual description in the other. The dual version often exhibits properties that
are useful for solving problems in the original setting.
% These dualities have demonstrated the existence of an underlying theory of
% which the individual string theories are only facets. 
We will work in the string theory which has proven
to be the most
fruitful for models of cosmological inflation, Type IIB. 
% 
% The most striking prediction of string theory is the existence of other
% dimensions beyond the four space-time dimensions that we
% experience. Recovering the physics of our familiar $3+1$ dimensional universe
% clearly requires that these extra dimensions be hidden in some way. How this
% is
% achieved is one of the signature features of any complete string theoretical
% description of the universe.

\subsection{Cosmology and String Theory}
Temperatures in the early univerese were far in excess of those attainable by
any earth-bound particle accelerator. Hence a stringent test of any high energy
theory is whether it predicts the same properties of the early universe that are
now being observed in the CMB and elsewhere.
For this reason any string theory description of the universe must include a
consistent cosmological narrative. 

In Chapter \ref{ch:introduction} inflation was put forward as the leading
explanation of the early development of the universe. For string theory to be
a consistent framework in the inflationary paradigm it must produce a period of
inflationary expansion. Inflation requires the input of physics beyond the SM
for its existence. Although usually described by SM scalar fields, there is no
inherent reason for the existence of such inflaton fields in the SM. Higher
energy theories such as string theory could provide an explanation for the
existence of inflaton fields. In this way inflation and string theory are
ideal partners and it is natural to consider them together when investigating
the early universe.

\subsection{Extra dimensions}
One of the basics results of string theory is that the 3 spacial dimensions that we see
around us are not the full extent of the space-time manifold. Instead
we live in a ten or
eleven dimensional space-time and physical theories in 3+1 dimensions must
compensate for the
other 6 or 7 dimensions that are hidden from us. One of the challenges of string theory is how 
to hide these extra dimensions in such a way as to recover standard physical
results in the usual
ones. 

The early work of Kaluza and Klein in formulating higher dimensional 
theories laid the groundwork for the current treatment of extra dimensions in
string theory \cite{Kaluza1921, Klein1926}. They found that by
compactifying an extra dimension onto a circle of finite radius an infinite
tower of extra fields would be introduced into the lower dimensional theory. The
mass of these fields is inversely proportional to the size of the extra
dimension. By taking the radius to be extremely small the appearance of these
unobserved massive fields is avoided. This leaves a
massless degree of freedom which must be accounted for in the four-dimensional
effective action. 


A similar procedure is undertaken when compactifying string theory from a
10 or 11 dimensional description down to four dimensions (for reviews see
\cite{douglas,grana}).
In ten dimensional type IIB theory the six extra dimensions are
compactified into a Ricci flat Calabi-Yau (CY) manifold which can be described
by three complex coordinates \cite{Yau1977}. 
Because any Ricci flat metric can be
rescaled into another Ricci flat metric, there is no unique solution for the
metric on the CY manifold. Instead a family of solutions exists with many free
parameters. These remain after the compactification, in
analogy to the size of the extra dimension in KK compactification, and can vary
dependent on position in the four-dimensional space-time. They appear as fields
in the four-dimensional theory and are known as moduli. 
These fields are not subject to any symmetry and so their individual values
at different spacetime points can affect the physics at those points.





% Suppose we wish to reduce a theory in $(D+1)$ dimensions to one in
% $D$ dimensions. 
% We will ``compactify'' the 
% (here single) extra dimension on a circle of finite radius $L$ and
% denote the coordinate on the circle as $z$. 
% Assume that in $(D+1)$ 
% dimensions we have a metric tensor $\hat{g}_{MN}(x,z)$ where $M$ and
% $N$ run over all $(D+1)$ dimensions and 
% x signifies the $D$ coordinates of the lower-dimensional spacetime.
% Hats  denote quantities in the $(D+1)$ space-time.
% A Fourier decomposition of $\hat{g}_{MN}$ gives an infinite number
% of fields in $D$ dimensions:
% \begin{equation}
%  \hat{g}_{MN}(x,z) = \sum_n g_{MN}^{(n)}(x) e^{i\frac{nz}{L}}\,.
% \end{equation}
% The mode number $n$ is related to the mass of the resulting fields;
% modes with $n=0$ will be massless and those with
% $n \ne 0$ massive. This can be seen by considering the Klein-Gordon
% equation for a $(D+1)$ dimensional field $\hat{\varphi}$:


\subsection{T-duality}
\label{sec:tduality-dbiintro}
% T-Duality
Suppose we have a string theory compactified on a circle of radius $R$. Instead
of being a continuum, the momentum of a closed string takes discrete values
$n/R$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This is a KK tower of massive states. As we
complete a circuit around the compact dimension, the value of the coordinate
function embedding the string in the background will also increase by $2\pi w
R$ for $w \in \mathbb{Z}$. This $w$, called the winding number of the string,
can only be non-zero for closed strings which can be wrapped around the periodic
dimension.

The total mass of the string contains terms with both the KK tower of states
and the new tower of winding states:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:closedmass-dbiintro}
 M^2 = \frac{n^2}{R^2} + \frac{w^2 R^2}{\alpha'^2} + \cdots\,.
\end{equation}
If $R$ is taken to infinity the $w\ne 0$ states become infinitely massive and
only the $w=0$ state is left with a continuum of momentum values. Thus the
uncompactified result is recovered. However if $R\rightarrow0$ the $n\ne 0$
states are now infinitely massive as in the standard KK picture. Unlike that
scenario, there is now a continuum of winding states $w\ne 0$, again giving an
uncompactified dimension. This major departure from the standard
compactification result is a purely stringy effect. 

The formula for the mass spectrum, \eq{eq:closedmass-dbiintro}, is invariant
when $n$ and $w$ are exchanged given the transformation
\begin{equation}
 R \rightarrow R' = \frac{\alpha'}{R}\,.
\end{equation}
The new theory which is compactified on a circle of radius $R'$ is known as the
T-dual theory and the transformation is called T-duality
\cite{Sakai1986,Kikkawa1984b}. The two
theories,
original and T-dual, are physically identical; T-duality is an exact symmetry
of string theory for closed strings.

% 
\subsection{D-branes}
\label{sec:dbranes-dbiintro}
% Open string + T-duality = Dirichlet boundary conditions
% 
% Mixed Dirichlet and von Neumann boundary conditions.
% 
% D-p branes, open strings end on p+1 ? dimensional manifold.
% 
% For Type IIB we have D-1,3,5,7 branes
% 
% See Johnson p80 for D-brane action.
% 
% Brane inflation was first considered without moduli stabilization (pg21
% Douglas
% and Kachru for refs). This gave a potential similar to hybrid inflation with
% waterfall field. KKLMMT argued that the corrections from including moduli
% stabilization were too big to ignore.
Despite using string theory we will not be dealing with strings themselves.
Instead we will consider the dynamics of extended objects known as branes and
in particular we will use Dirichlet- or D-branes. As mentioned above string
theories are linked by T-duality. Fundamental parameters are translated by the
duality including the size of the extra-dimensions, the string coupling and the
coordinate solutions of the strings.


In Section \ref{sec:tduality-dbiintro} we introduced T-duality by explaining
its effects on closed strings. But what happens when open strings are
T-dualised? Open strings, as their name suggests, have two open ends and
consequently cannot have a conserved winding number like $w$. Again suppose one
of the $D$ dimensions is compactified. As $R\rightarrow0$ the non-zero momentum
states get infinitely massive but in contrast to the closed case there is now
no continuum of winding states. Thus the theory now lives in one less
dimension similar to standard KK compactification.

There are still closed strings in this theory however, and these continue to
move in the full $D$ dimensions. The endpoints of the open strings now observe
Dirichlet boundary conditions, taking fixed values in the compactified
direction. This follows through if more than one coordinate is made periodic.
If $D-p-1$ spatial dimensions are compactified then the ends of the open
strings ca still move freely in the other $p$ stpatial dimensions on a $p+1$
dimensional hypersurface called a Dirichlet or D$p$-brane. 
% 
In Type IIB theory with supersymmetric string an extra condition means that
only D$p$-branes with $p=1,3,5,7,9$ are allowed \footnotemark.
\footnotetext{There is also a $p=-1$ D-instanton in which the time direction
along with all spatial directions is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions
\cite{Green1992,Green1988,Green1977}.}
% 

D$p$-branes can be considered as dynamical objects in their own right with a
tension\footnote{$T_p$ here is $\tau_p$ in \cite{Johnson2000}.}
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:branetensiondefn-dbiintro}
 T_p = \frac{m_s^{p+1}}{(2\pi)^p g_s}\,,
\end{equation}
% 
where $g_s$ is the string coupling and $m_s$ is the string mass scale.
Their dynamics is governed by the action 
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gendbiaction-dbiintro}
 S = -T_p \int d^{p+1}\xi \sqrt{-\hat{g}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{g}_{ab}$ is the induced metric on the brane with internal
coordinates $\xi^a$ for $a=0,\ldots,p$. This is the general form of the DBI
action which will be used later.

\subsection{D-brane inflation}
At its most basic slow-roll inflation requires only a single scalar field with a
sufficiently flat potential to satisfy the slow roll conditions outlined in
Section \ref{sec:slowroll-intro}. D-branes are charged (with Ramond-Ramond
charge) and we can consider a system of a D-brane and an anti-D-brane
($\overline{\mathrm{D}}$). As the two branes attract each other the distance
between them can be used as a decreasing scalar degree of freedom, the
inflaton \cite{brane1,brane2,brane3,brane7}. 
When the branes collide they will annihilate and produce energy which would
reheat the universe. 

As described in Section \ref{sec:extradims} compacitifying dimensions
introduces scalar fields known as moduli. These massless fields must be
accounted for in the dynamics unless some way is found to ``stabilize'' them by
fixing their mass to be large enough that they do not interfere.
Initial efforts to induce inflation using D-branes ignored the issue of moduli
stabilization. Instead they
assumed that whatever stabilization technique was used would have no discernable
effect on the inflationary physics [cite kklt***]. Kac

\subsection{Warped throats}
\label{sec:warpedthroats-dbiintro}
% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % 
The moduli must
be stabilized so that they do not appear in the effective action as
massless fields. This can be achieved by switching on background fluxes in the
compactified space. These fluxes are the equivalents of magnetic
fields in the higher dimensional space. By Gauss' theorem  the compact space
will now have a quantized non-zero total charge.
In the presence of fluxes a general form of metric with a warp factor is
possible:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:warpedmetric-dbiintro}
 ds^2 = e^{2A(y)}\eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu + e^{-2A(y)} g_{mn}dy^m dy^n\,,
\end{equation}
where $A(y)$ varies across the compact dimensions $y^m$.
Compactifications in which $A$ varies significantly with $y$ are called warped
compactifications. These warped compactifications are qualitatively similar to
the Randall-Sundrum picture \cite{Randall1999,Brummer2006}.


Flux compactification of type IIB string theory to four dimensions 
results in such a warped geometry, where the six-dimensional CY  
manifold contains one or more throats \cite{douglas,gkp,grana}. 
The metric inside a throat takes the same form as in
\eq{eq:warpedmetric-dbiintro}:
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conemetric-dbiintro}
ds_{10}^2= h^2 ( \rho) ds_4^2 + h^{-2} (\rho ) 
\left( d\rho^2 +\rho^2 ds_{X_5}^2 \right) \,,
\end{equation}
%  
where the warp factor $h (\rho)$ is a function of the 
radial coordinate $\rho$ along the throat and $X_5$
is a Sasaki-Einstein five-manifold. 


In many cases, the ten-dimensional metric (\ref{eq:conemetric-dbiintro}) can be 
approximated locally by the geometry $AdS_5 \times X_5$, where the 
warp factor is given by $h=\rho /L$ and 
the radius of curvature of the $AdS_5$ space is defined by
%  
\begin{equation}
L^4 \equiv \frac{4\pi^4 g_s N}{{\rm Vol} (X_5) m_s^4} \,,
\end{equation}
% 
such that $\mathrm{Vol}(X_5)$ is the dimensionless volume of 
$X_5$ with unit radius and $N$ is the ${\rm D3}$  charge of the throat.


% In the bulk of the Calabi-Yau space $e^A \simeq 1$ so there is no warping. The
% SM brane could live here and not feel any effects of the warping.

In the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) background \cite{ks}, the throat 
is a warped deformed conifold and 
corresponds to a cone over the manifold 
$X_5 = T^{1,1}= {\rm SU(2)} \otimes {\rm SU(2)}/{\rm U(1)}$
in the UV limit ($\rho \rightarrow \infty$). This has   
a volume $\mathrm{Vol} (T^{1,1}) = 16\pi^3/27$ and  topology
$S^2\times S^3$, where the $S^2$ is fibred over the $S^3$.

\missingfigure{Add figure of warped deformed conifold}   

There are two 3-cycles in the warped throat. The first is the $S^3$ subspace and
is known as the A-cycle. The second, called the B-cycle, is the $S^2$ times a
circle extended in the direction of the throat radius. The three-form fluxes
$F_3$ and $H_3$, aligned with these cycles, are turned on to make the warped
throat a solution of the Einstein equations. The cycles are threaded with
quantized units of flux $M$ and $K$ given by: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:fluxdefn-dbiintro}
 \frac{1}{2\pi\alpha'}\int_A F_3 &=& M \,, \\
 \frac{1}{2\pi\alpha'}\int_B H_3 &=& -K\,, 
\end{eqnarray}
where $M,K\in \mathbb{Z}$.
The D$3$ charge of the throat, $N$, is related to the quantized fluxes by
$N=MK$.
The wrapping of the fluxes along the cycles of the conifold smooths out the
conical singularity at the tip of the throat with an $S^3$ ``cap'' 
\cite{ks,kt} and the warp factor asymptotes to 
a constant value in this region.


In this section we have provided an overview of the concepts that will be
required to discuss DBI inflation. The compactified warped throat described
here will provide the setting for this string theory implementation of
inflation. In Section \ref{sec:stringcos-dbiintro} we outlined how cosmological
observations can constrain the parameter space of string theories. In the next
section we connect the geometry and physics of the string compactification with
inflationary cosmology and establish the observational parameters which will be
used to formulate these constraints.

\addtodo{ More introduction of type IIB theory}
% We will now concentrate on one particular non-canonical action. 
The DBI scenario is based on the compactification of type IIB string theory on a 
Calabi-Yau (CY) three-fold, where the form-field fluxes generate locally
warped regions known as `throats' described above.  The propagation of a 
${\rm D3}$-brane in such a region can drive inflation, where the inflaton 
field is identified with the radial position of the brane 
along the throat. Since this is an open string mode, the field 
equation for the inflaton is determined by a DBI action.

\missingfigure{Figure highlighting radial direction in throat}

In general, the low-energy world-volume dynamics
of a probe ${\rm D3}$-brane in a warped throat is determined 
by an effective, four-dimensional DBI action, as described in Section
\ref{sec:warpedthroats-dbiintro}.
The inflaton field is related to the radial 
position of the brane by 
$\varphi \equiv \sqrt{T_3} \rho$, where $T_3$ 
is the brane tension defined in \eq{eq:branetensiondefn-dbiintro}. The action is
then given by 
% 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:DBIaction-dbiintro}
S=\int  d^4x \sqrt{|g|} \left[ \frac{\Mpl^2}{2} R 
+ P (\varphi , X) \right] \\
\label{defP}
P( \varphi ,X) = - T (\varphi)  \sqrt{1 - 2T^{-1} (\varphi ) X}
+T (\varphi)  -V(\varphi)  \,,
\end{eqnarray}
% 
where $R$ is the Ricci curvature scalar,
$X \equiv - \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \nabla_{\mu} \varphi \nabla_{\nu} \varphi$
is the kinetic energy of the inflaton, $V(\varphi )$ denotes 
the field's interaction 
potential and $T(\varphi ) = T_3 h^4 (\varphi )$
defines the warped brane tension. As in Section \ref{sec:noncanoninfl} we refer
to $P(\varphi , X)$ as the ``kinetic function'' for the inflaton. 

We consider a spatially flat and isotropic cosmology 
sourced by a homogeneous scalar field. 
In this case, the Friedmann equations for a monotonically 
varying inflaton can be expressed in the form \cite{brane6} 
% 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:Friedmann-dbiintro}
3 \Mpl^2 H^2(\varphi ) &=& V(\varphi ) -T(\varphi ) 
\left[ 1- \sqrt{1+4\Mpl^4T^{-1} H'^2} \right] \,,\\
\label{useful}
\dot{\varphi} &=& - \frac{2\Mpl^2H'}{\sqrt{1+4\Mpl^4 T^{-1} H'^2}} \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
% 
where $H=H(\varphi )$ represents the Hubble parameter
as a function of the field and a prime denotes $d/d\varphi$. 

\addtodo{Remove duplicate information, is it already in Non-canonical section?}
An important consequence of the non-trivial kinetic structure 
of the DBI action is that the sound speed of fluctuations in the inflaton 
differs from unity:   
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:csdefn-dbiintro}
c_s = \frac{1}{P_{,X}} = \sqrt{1 -2T^{-1}X}  \,,
\end{equation}
% 
where a subscripted comma denotes partial differentiation. 
Furthermore, the condition that the sound speed be real 
imposes an upper bound on the kinetic energy 
of the inflaton, $\dot{\varphi}^2 < T(\varphi)$, which 
is independent of the steepness of the potential.
The motion of the brane is said to be `relativistic' when this bound is 
close to saturation.
 

We now define the epoch that is directly 
accessible to cosmological observations as `observable inflation'. 
Depending on the reheating 
temperature, this occurred some 30 to 60 e-foldings before the end of 
inflation. We will assume that the slow roll conditions described in 
Section~\ref{sec:slowroll-intro} apply during observable inflation.
The definitions of the slow roll parameters described in that section 
change when $c_s$ is not unity and we
will include a third parameter $s$ which quantifies the rate of change of $c_s$.
The inflationary dynamics during this phase can  
be quantified in terms of these three parameters: 
% 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:epsdefn-dbiintro}
\epsilon_H \equiv -\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2}
= \frac{XP_{,X}}{\Mpl^2H^2} 
= \frac{2\Mpl^2}{\gamma} \left( \frac{H'}{H} \right)^2 \\
\label{eq:defeta-dbiintro}
\eta_H \equiv  \frac{2\Mpl^2}{\gamma}\frac{H''}{H} \\
\label{eq:defs-dbiintro}
s \equiv \frac{\dot{c_s}}{c_sH} 
= \frac{2\Mpl^2}{\gamma} \frac{H'}{H}\frac{\gamma'}{\gamma}  \,,
\end{eqnarray}
% 
where $\gamma \equiv 1/c_s$. 
We will assume that the `slow-roll' conditions 
$\{ \epsilon_H, |\eta_H | , |s | \}  \ll 1$ applied during observable inflation. 
In this regime, the amplitudes and spectral indices of the two-point functions 
for the scalar and tensor perturbations are given by \cite{gm}
% 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:spectra-dbiintro}
P_S^2= \frac{1}{8 \pi^2 \Mpl^2} \frac{H^2}{c_s \epsilon_H}
= \frac{H^4}{4\pi^2\dot{\varphi}^2}
\\
P_T^2 = \frac{2}{\pi^2} \frac{H^2}{\Mpl^2} 
\\
\label{indices}
1-n_s = 4 \epsilon_H -2\eta_H  +2s 
\\
 n_t = -2\epsilon_H  
\end{eqnarray}
% 
respectively, where the quantities on the right-hand sides are evaluated 
when the scale with comoving wavenumber $k=aH\gamma$ crossed 
the Hubble radius during inflation.  
\addtodo{ Talk about difference with standard k=aH and compare consistency relation with 
standard one.}
The tensor-scalar ratio, $r \equiv P_T^2/P_S^2$, is directly related to 
the tensor spectral index by \cite{gm}
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:consistency-dbiintro}
r= -8c_sn_t = 16c_s \epsilon_H\,.
\end{equation}
%
Hence, a sound speed different to unity leads to a violation of the 
standard inflationary consistency equation, which might be 
detectable in the foreseeable future \cite{lidser1,lidser2}. 
\addtodo{WMAP5}
Recent observations of the CMB 
indicate that $P^2_S=2.5 \times 10^{-9}$ and $r < 0.55$ \cite{spergel}. 
The best-fit value for a constant spectral index is 
$n_s = 0.987^{+0.019}_{-0.037}$ if $r\ne 0$ is assumed as a prior. 
This is strengthened to 
$n_s = 0.948^{+0.015}_{-0.018}$ for a prior of $r = 0$ \cite{spergel}. 


A further important consequence of a small sound speed is that departures  
from purely Gaussian statistics may be large 
\cite{brane6,brane11,lidser3,chenetal}. 
\addtodo{Link to intro section on $\fnl$. Remove duplicate information. Add note about using equilateral in
next two chapters.}
It is conventional 
to quantify such deviations by expressing the non-Gaussian curvature 
perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ in the form 
${\cal{R}} ={\cal{R}}_G + \frac{3}{5}\fnl
({\cal{R}}^2_G -\langle {\cal{R}}^2_G \rangle)$, where 
${\cal{R}}_G$ represents the Gaussian contribution, 
the quadratic piece is a convolution and $\fnl$ defines 
the `non-linearity' parameter \cite{maldacena}. 
In general, this parameter is a function of the three momenta which 
form a triangle in Fourier space. However, in the limit where 
these momenta have equal magnitude, the non-linearity parameter 
is given to leading-order by \cite{chenetal,lidser2}  
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fnlcs-dbiintro}
\fnl = -\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{1}{c_s^2} -1 \right) \,.
\end{equation}
% 
\addtodo{ Change to WMAP5 numbers}
Currently, WMAP3 constrains this parameter  
to be ${| \fnl |} \, {\lsim} \, {300}$ \cite{spergel,crim}.  


Finally, Eqs. (\ref{eq:csdefn-dbiintro}), (\ref{eq:spectra-dbiintro}) and (\ref{eq:fnlcs-dbiintro}) 
may be combined to constrain the warped brane tension 
during observable inflation: 
% 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:obswarp-dbiintro}
\frac{T (\varphi_*)}{\Mpl^4}  = 
\frac{\pi^2}{16} r^2P_S^2 \left( 1-\frac{1}{3\fnl} \right) \,,
\end{equation}
% 
where a subscript `$*$' denotes that the quantity is to be evaluated 
at that epoch. 


\addtodo{ Change to chapter references}
In the next chapter, we will first consider the UV version of DBI inflation,
where the brane moves relativistically 
towards the tip of the throat. We will assume implicitly 
that the sound speed is sufficiently small to generate a non-Gaussianity with magnitude in 
excess of $|\fnl| \, {\gsim} \, 5$, since this is the projected 
sensitivity of the Planck satellite \cite{planck}. Furthermore, we consider   
an arbitrary warp factor and inflaton potential, 
subject only to the condition that a sufficiently long phase of 
quasi-exponential expansion can be maintained to solve the horizon problem of
the hot big bang model.
